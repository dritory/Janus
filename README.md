# Janus

This is a ongoing rougelike game project based on the [TCOD-library](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/), written in C#.
No documentation exist, and the code is mostly written to work, not for readability. 
Might be worth looking at the modular component system and file-to-actor system though, as well as the map generator.
